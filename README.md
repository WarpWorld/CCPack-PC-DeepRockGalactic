### METHOD 1 - DRG SIDE LOADER

Download the DRG Mod Loader Application. It can be downloaded from the latest releases here: https://github.com/trumank/mint


Extract the application zip to a folder (This can be anywhere). And run the exe.


Download the CC_#.pak file from either this google drive, or mod.io, and save it to your folder with the mod loader .exe. Then drag or copy paste it into your mod loader with any other mods you want to use.


Hit “Install mods” and you’re good to go, just use the Crowd Control app as normal. You do not need the mod loader open when running your game. To return to vanilla simply reopen the mod engine and click “Uninstall mods”.

### METHOD 2 - MOD.IO SUBSCRIPTION
Go to https://mod.io/g/drg/m/crowd-control and click the subscribe button.


Load DRG and wait for the mod to automatically install, then restart your game.
Use the crowd control app as normal.
